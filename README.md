Hi there! 👋  
I’m Spidey — I enjoy building things across platforms and keeping them clean, modern, and simple.

These days I’m focused on:

Mobile apps with Flutter  
Web experiences with React & Tailwind  
Clean architecture & scalable project structure  
Learning cybersecurity & secure system design  

I like working on small, thoughtful projects with polish and smooth user experiences.

Fun Facts:

Anime & gaming enthusiast 🎮  
Gym keeps me disciplined 💪  
Curious about how systems work — and how to secure them 🔐
